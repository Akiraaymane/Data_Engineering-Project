Feedback:

	•	reviews_all is great when you want to get all the available reviews but it can be problematic sometimes because you might hit the rate limit easily, and Be hard to control especially in production. Try reviews with pagination.
	•	Think about writing with append in the loop; it is always better to prevent data loss if code crashes
	•	I don’t see the dashboard.html file in the repo
